                Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer, counted amongst the top sportsmen in India. Considered
                to be among the best batsmen in the present era, he also doubles up as an occasional right-arm medium
                pace bowler. He is known for his dependable and powerful batting style and has single-handedly won
                several matches for India. Virat became fascinated with cricket quite early on in his life and took to
                the bat when he was just three. His parents recognized his potential and had him enrolled at the West
                Delhi Cricket Academy when he was nine years old. He developed into a very talented player over the
                ensuing years and represented his city Delhi at various age-group levels and domestic cricket. His first
                major success came in 2008 when he captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup.
                Soon he was selected to play for the Indian team and established himself as a valuable middle order
                player. After having gained a reputation as an “ODI specialist”, he has proved his mettle in test
                cricket as well. Virat Kohli captained the Indian cricket team across all three formats, between 2013
                and 2022. He is married to famous Indian actress Anushka Sharma.
